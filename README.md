# WebApp-for-Cognitive-distortion-analysis-and-classification-in-Bengali-Language

We developed six deep learning models from the ground up based on the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) and trained on the labeled text to detect eight cognitive distortions. The accuracy values of the models were 0.76 for overgeneralization, 0.85 for all or none thinking, 0.80 for mind reading, 0.83 for fortune telling, 0.80 for labeling, 0.93 for should statement, 0.86 for emotional reasoning, 0.97 for personalization. We then introduced a web app powered by these deep learning models to identify eight types of cognitive distortions. The web app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting Bengali text and receiving predictions about the presence of cognitive distortions. This tool has the potential to be used by therapists and counselors to aid in the assessment of cognitive distortions in Bengali-speaking clients. To our knowledge, this is the first work in Bengali language to detect cognitive distortions using AI. ![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
